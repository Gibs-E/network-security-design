# Network Security Design Project

This project simulates a segmented three-zone network using Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates basic network security measures including access control lists (ACLs), VLAN segmentation, and risk mitigation strategies.

## Zones:
- **Inside Zone:** 192.168.1.0/24 (PC-A)
- **Guest Zone:** 172.16.33.0/24 (PC-C)
- **Outside Zone:** Public-facing (via R2)

## Security Features:
- ACLs to block unauthorized traffic
- VLAN isolation
- Basic firewall rules
- Risk assessment & mitigation strategies

## Files Included:
