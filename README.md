# Network Security Design Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure three-zone network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. It simulates real-world enterprise segmentation with an Inside Zone, Guest Zone, and Public-facing Outside Zone, and applies security controls to protect sensitive resources.

Key Features
	•	VLAN Segmentation – isolates traffic between zones
	•	Access Control Lists (ACLs) – block unauthorized traffic
	•	Firewall Rules – enforce basic perimeter defense
	•	Risk Assessment & Mitigation – documented strategies for common threats

Deliverables
	•	Topology Diagram – visual representation of the three-zone design
	•	5-Page Report – detailed documentation covering configuration, security decisions, and mitigation strategies
	•	Cisco Packet Tracer Implementation – practical simulation of the full design

## Zones:
- **Inside Zone:** 192.168.1.0/24 (PC-A)
- **Guest Zone:** 172.16.33.0/24 (PC-C)
- **Outside Zone:** Public-facing (via R2)

## Security Features:
- ACLs to block unauthorized traffic
- VLAN isolation
- Basic firewall rules
- Risk assessment & mitigation strategies
